HOW TO
======
-   Run/Execute all of your test cases with your existing tools (Shell script is also fine :-) )
-   Option 1
    -   Have your all test "Features" -> "Scenarios" -> "Cases" defined in JSON inside TestReport.html
    -   Keep "status" placeholders for each scenarios & cases and update/replace them as per actual execution status.
-   Option 2
    -   Generate JSON block inside TestReport.html file entirely from your test suite

TODO
====
-   Show failure reason details
-   Allow embedded images (img source data attributes)
-   Replace AngularJS with ReactJS to allow server-side rendering and export to PDF/IMG
